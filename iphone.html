              <p class="card-text">The first-generation iPhone was extremely thin (only 11.6 mm thick) but wider and longer than many comparable devices. The display area was a 3.5 inch-wide screen with a multitouch interface and unusually high resolution (160 pixels per inch). Unlike most other smartphones at the time, iPhone did not use a hardware keyboard or a stylus. Instead, a user relied on multiple taps and drags to navigate through iPhone OS 1.0, a mobile version of Apple's OS X for Mac computers. Like the iPod, the iPhone synchronized data with a user's personal computer via a USB port, using Apple iTunes as client software.</p>

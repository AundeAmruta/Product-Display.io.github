They are the fourteenth-generation, lower-priced iPhones, succeeding the iPhone 11. They were unveiled at a virtually held Apple Special Event at Apple Park in Cupertino, California on October 13, 2020, alongside the higher-end iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max flagships. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 started on October 16, 2020, and the phone became available in most countries on October 23, 2020. Pre-orders for the iPhone 12 Mini began on November 6, 2020, and the phone became available on November 13, 2020.[3]

The major upgrades over the iPhone 11 include the addition of a Super Retina XDR OLED as opposed to the Liquid Retina LED-backlit LCD IPS panel on the iPhone 11 and XR, 5G support, the introduction of MagSafe, Apple A14 Bionic system on a chip (SoC), high-dynamic-range video Dolby Vision 4K up to 30 fps and a new Mini model.</p>
